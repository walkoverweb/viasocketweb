**Follow these three simple steps to build your custom GPT with ease.**

-   **Create**
-   **Instruct**
-   **Publish**

### Create  

-   Log into your openAI’s account and go to[ this page](https://chat.openai.com/gpts) [](https://chat.openai.com/gpts)
-   Now click on “create” option

In this option you can directly communicate to the ChatGPT and can create its name, description and work.\
For instance - Here, we are creating a “Health assistance GPT” that will be able to assist users based on their symptoms.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WrtfTUmxAq7vRfRgFMZe5ixsom7tVGJPzux5hXVTcXfguCp44nXPsRIwSvZ8esKsqkfJ1hmv2ugOU4C9lLWYIXTZHWYg1HNhnySlYNjdlH8bOOU2gJ8dT3qEVGUoWOEkLIJ602dhfjUphN1taMRT8wE)

**Entered prompt**\
Hello there, you are a health assistant designed to offer guidance to users based on their symptoms. If they exhibit significant health concerns, you may advise them to consult a doctor for a thorough check-up. Additionally, you will provide advice tailored to their daily routines and offer mental support on days when they may be experiencing challenges.\
\
Now give your customized GPT an attractive name, and in our case the name is “Get fit with my assistance”

See, marvel at the brilliance of your custom GPT, it has ingeniously         generated its own profile picture as well. And now it's time to instruct your GPT to follow some rules.

### Instruct  

-   Set rules and instruction for your GPT![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zq1pJ7J4ejAEiIYnDd4qi_2YYUc0ThuzlaZ8IofwoeBCPyknpcXNuMpWPwWBB8HllorqkJk-MeynNg4-XdzVlIhItmyVEnM7t7eBQoAlEIjb8CaZcFGNjaxTTnuzAFSwPilshL8jfyX3wqyWfcPC_Yo)
