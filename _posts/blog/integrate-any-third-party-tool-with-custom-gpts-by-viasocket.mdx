Gaining **100 million** users in just two months after the launch of ChatGPT, has set a record and that can give us a revolutionized glimpse of the near future as well. Don’t you think extensive use of **chatGPT** has defined a brand new way of work in businesses? Additionally, a few days ago the launch of custom GPTs has opened the door of golden opportunities for GPTs builders and users. Doesn't it sound great? But the problem that arises here is to get the real time data from your custom GPT.\
\
And here **viaSocket** comes into play, it is a **workflow** automation platform that helps you to integrate multiple applications at one place. By integrating your custom GPTs to viaSocket you can give instructions and get real time data from multiple third party tools at one place. Isn’t it amazing? Furthermore, with this integration you are allowing your **custom GPTs** to perform actions on **100+ apps available on viaSocket. See [what is viaSocket.](https://viasocket.com/blog/what-is-viasocket)**\
\
In simple terms **viaSocket** allows you to give your **GPTs** the power to perform actions across various apps, Yes! You read that write!

**Here is a complete guide of integrating a custom GPT with viaSocket by your own set of rules and instructions. Additionally, If you want to learn how to create a custom GPT see [this blog.](https://viasocket.com/blog/slug)**\
\
There are two ways by which you can integrate viaSocket with your custom GPT.\
 **Using OAuth Key** \
 **Using API key**  \
\
**A. Using OAuth Key** \
**1. Create your custom GPT using OAuth**

Create a custom GPT with the power of viaSocket’s automation.

Just simply follow the “create” and “instruct” steps of [this blog](https://viasocket.com/blog/how-to-create-a-custom-gpt)

and click on the action button at last in the configure section.\

\
**So what are the actions?**\
Well, You don't need to worry about actions or **anything.** just simply follow these steps and connect your **custom GPT to viaSocket.**

**2. Select Authentication option as OAuth.**

\
Soon all these credentials like **Client id**, **Client Secret**, **Authorization URL**, **Token URL** and scopes will be available for you on your **viaSocket’s account**. But in case you want it right now then first of all [sign-up](https://viasocket.com/) and just drop a mail with below content [at](support@viasocket.com)\
\
**Subject - Integrate Custom GPTs to viaSocket using OAuth**\
**Body-** \
**Hello,**\
\
**This is John from xyz. I am willing to integrate viaSocket with my custom GPT. Kindly  provide me with the Client id, Client Secret, Authorization URL,**\
**Token URL and scopes asap.**\
\
**Thanks**\
**John**

**3. Import url**\
Just simply copy this URL and click on the option import from url and paste it there.\

\
**4. Save & Publish**\
Go to the update option and publish it with everyone.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vM4O3LiKwRCXOxV2GhIc7Pyebcu7nCP9ZrjxFqKD54tetBHvidxx_bRoqTkkTqfMZOu37jk-nVvwB0h_IIDHIalfjUklvRTdJLgqqDCk0xS9XZAyf6KavjjCMvZsVg1faupQ0hP6SLAB1plxarXWulV24qXRxlPZSiJkaUGDxzh2vdoEcLzucUPe74lixg)

Now your **custom GPT is connected to your viaSocket account**. With this thing you will have access to unlimited apps available in the viaSocket. You just need to authenticate applications you wish to connect with GPT.\
**Example-**\
For example you want to send a message on slack with your google calendar events then you just need to give a prompt to your GPT saying “check my google calendar and send a message on xyz slack channel”. **Your GPT** will ask you to **authorize** these apps and after the **authentication** you can get the real time data directly within your customGPT.

**B. Using API Key** \
**1. Create your custom GPT using API key**

Create a custom GPT with the power of viaSocket’s automation.\
Just simply follow the “**create**” and “**instruct**” steps of [this blog](https://viasocket.com/blog/how-to-create-a-custom-gpt)[](https://viasocket.com/blog/how-to-create-a-custom-gpt)**and click on the action button at last in the configure section.**\

**H﻿ere are some usecases of custom GPTs** \
**1. Real-Time Social Media Management**\
Integrate a custom GPT model with **CMS** and social media platforms through **viaSocket** for real-time content creation and engagement. The model generates and schedules posts on platforms like **WordPress, Twitter, and Facebook,** and actively **monitors** and responds to user interactions and brand mentions, enabling dynamic, real-time social media management.\
\
**2. Enhanced Customer Support with Real-Time Data**\
Utilize **viaSocket** to integrate a **custom GPT** model with customer support tools like **Zendesk, Freshdesk, or ServiceNow.** This setup allows the model to handle customer inquiries in real-time, providing immediate responses. For complex issues, it escalates tickets to human support, leveraging real-time data for efficient and responsive customer service.
