description: Unlock unparalleled efficiency in customer support with viaSocket. Wave goodbye to manual ticket entry as viaSocket's automation tools effortlessly manage incoming inquiries, ensuring no customer concern is overlooked
---

Imagine your support team receiving dozens of emails, messages, and calls from customers every day. Each of these inquiries needs to be manually entered into the support system, which takes a lot of time and can lead to mistakes. This manual process also means that it's harder for support agents to keep track of who needs help and what needs to be done.

In essence, without workflow automation, customer support can feel like navigating a maze without a map – confusing, inefficient, and ultimately frustrating for both your team and your customers. By automating repetitive tasks and optimizing workflows, viaSocket empowers your customer support team to deliver exceptional service efficiently, ultimately leading to happier customers and a more productive team.

**4. Integrate support tickets with spreadsheets for easy tracking**

**5. Generate tickets from custom websites using webhooks.**

### 1. Turn form submissions into support tickets<a id="1-turn-form-submissions-into-support-tickets"></a>

Imagine you run a small e-commerce store, and you use **Google Forms** to collect feedback from customers about their shopping experience. Without automation, each time a customer submits a form, someone from your support team would need to manually create a support ticket in **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk** to address their feedback.

However, with integration in place, as soon as they submit the form, a support ticket is automatically generated in **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk**. This means your support team can see the issue right away and start working on a solution without any manual input.

-   **Integrate Zendesk with Typeform** to automatically create **Zendesk** tickets whenever there are new entries in **Typeform**.

*   **Integrate Zendesk with Google Forms** to automatically generate **Zendesk** tickets when new responses are submitted via **Google Forms**.

-   **Integrate Freshdesk with Google Forms** to generate **Freshdesk** tickets for each new response received in **Google Forms**.

### 2. Alert your team about new support tickets<a id="2-alert-your-team-about-new-support-tickets"></a>

Integrating apps like **Slack** and **Microsoft Teams** with platforms such as **Zendesk** and **Freshdesk** can greatly improve communication and collaboration within your support team. With this integration in place, whenever a new support ticket is created in **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk**, an automated alert can be sent directly to your team's **Slack** channel or **Microsoft Teams** workspace. This ensures that your support team is immediately aware of incoming requests, enabling them to respond promptly and provide timely assistance to customers.

-   **Integrate Zendesk with Slack** to post messages in **Slack** whenever new tickets are created in **Zendesk**.

*   **Integrate Zendesk with Microsoft Teams** to automatically post new **Zendesk** tickets as messages in **Microsoft Teams**.

-   **Integrate Freshdesk with Slack** to receive notifications in **Slack** whenever new tickets are created in **Freshdesk**.

### 3. Update and assign tickets to the right teams<a id="3-update-and-assign-tickets-to-the-right-teams"></a>

Integrating apps like **Trello** and **Asana** with platforms such as **Zendesk** and **Freshdesk** can significantly streamline your ticket management process and ensure that each ticket is assigned to the right team promptly. For example, when a new support ticket comes in, it automatically creates a task or card in **Trello** or **Asana**, assigning it to the relevant team.

Furthermore, each task or card in **Trello** or **Asana** can be linked back to the original ticket in **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk**, making it easy to monitor progress and ensure nothing gets overlooked.

-   **Integrate Zendesk with Trello** to automatically create **Trello** cards for each new **Zendesk** ticket.

*   **Integrate Zendesk with Asana** to seamlessly add new **Zendesk** tickets as tasks within **Asana's** platform.

-   **Integrate Freshdesk with Trello** to efficiently generate **Trello** cards for every new **Freshdesk** ticket.

### 4. Integrate support tickets with spreadsheets for easy tracking<a id="4-integrate-support-tickets-with-spreadsheets-for-easy-tracking"></a>

This integration with spreadsheet apps like **Google Sheets** and **Excel**  provides a centralized hub for tracking support metrics and analyzing trends. You can create customized reports and dashboards in your spreadsheet app to monitor key performance indicators such as response times, ticket resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores. With real-time data synced between your support platform and spreadsheet app, you can make data-driven decisions to improve your support processes and enhance the overall customer experience.

-   **Integrate Zendesk with Google Sheets** to compile new **Zendesk** tickets as entries within **Google Sheets.**

*   **Integrate Zendesk with Microsoft Excel** to log new **Zendesk** tickets as rows in **Microsoft Excel** spreadsheets.

-   **Integrate Freshdesk with Microsoft Excel** to automatically generate new rows in **Microsoft Excel** for each new **Freshdesk** ticket.

### 5. Generate Tickets from Custom Websites Using Webhooks<a id="5-generate-tickets-from-custom-websites-using-webhooks"></a>
