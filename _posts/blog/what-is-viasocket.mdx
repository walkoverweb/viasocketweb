We take pride in staying at the forefront of **business process automation**, ensuring that your workflows are always up-to-date and efficient. Let's dive into the impressive features that **viaSocket** brings to the table.

**Flow**

The first thing you will notice when you enter the Flow in **viaSocket** is the clean and user-friendly interface. This is designed to make the workflow creation process as smooth as possible.

Flow in **viaSocket** is the playground for workflow automation, its main purpose is to help users create workflows. Here you can also write a description of your workflow, ask our AI for assistance, and access all the variables used in the workflow and Dry Run your workflow to check for errors.

Once you have created your workflow you can now click on Make Live to publish your workflow and use it. If you want to restart creating your workflow from scratch, you can click on Discard and start again. Once the workflow has been published you can come back here to Pause or Delete it. On the other hand, if you want to create a similar workflow, you can also Duplicate an existing one and make necessary changes.

**Logs**

Logs in **viaSocket** allows you to view and analyse the data of your workflow. It provides the detailed data that you can use to track the performance of your workflow. It generates data once the workflow has been published. Each log is generated once a workflow gets triggered and lists the request and response generated by the applications integrated in the workflow and also the response time taken.

In cases where the workflow is triggered but is unable to complete the intended actions, logs are also generated. These logs list any errors that were encountered during the execution of the workflow. This helps identify and fix any issues that may arise.

Each log is shown by the exact date and time it was generated.

Please note that logs are not generated for Dry Run, as this feature is only used for testing purposes.

**Triggers and Actions**

**Triggers and actions** are key components of workflow automation. Triggers are events or conditions that initiate a specific action or set of actions within a workflow. They act as a starting point for the automated process.

There are various types of triggers that can be used in workflow automation

-   time-based triggers, based on a specific date or time
-   event-based triggers, activated by a specific event, such as receiving an email or a form submission.

Once a trigger is activated, the workflow automation system will perform a series of predefined actions. These actions can include sending notifications, updating data, creating documents, or executing a specific task.

When this happens\[Triggers]

Do this\[Actions]

**viaSocket** allows for the creation of complex workflows with multiple actions. For example, a workflow may be triggered by a form submission, which then initiates an action to update a database, send a confirmation email, and assign a task to a specific team member.

**CRON**

Imagine having the ability to set your workflows on autopilot, triggering them at fixed times, specific days, or even on a monthly basis. That's Cron for you - the timekeeper that ensures your tasks are executed with clockwork precision.

**Cron Scheduler,** a feature that not only schedules your workflows but does it in a language everyone understands - plain and simple English.

**How to Speak to Cron:**

Choose Your Trigger Time: Tell Cron when you want your workflow to start.

For example, "Every day at 3 PM," or "On the 15th of every month at 10 AM."

**Webhook**

The "Webhook" is your direct link to triggering workflows effortlessly and serves as the gateway to instant automation. Instead of relying on scheduled intervals or manual triggers, a webhook let's external systems or applications notify viaSocket to kick off your workflows in real-time.

Real-time responsiveness.

When an event takes place on an external system connected to your "Webhook," your viaSocket workflows leap into action instantly, ensuring your processes are always up-to-dataHere’s how to integrate webhooks in your workflows:

-   Open the **viaSocket** workflow editor.
-   Integrate the "Webhook" block seamlessly into your workflow canvas.
-   Copy webhook URL and hit Save.
-   Link your "Webhook" URL to external platforms, applications, or services where events will act as triggers for your workflows.

As events occur on connected platforms, your **viaSocket** workflows will spring into action in real-time.

**Custom API Calls**

With the "API", you can connect with external services, fetch real-time data, and trigger actions on diverse platforms.

To add custom APIs visit the reference documentation pages of that API because you need to have a clear understanding of the purpose of your custom API and what functionality it will provide. This will help you determine what type of custom API call you need to make and how it will integrate with your existing workflow.

This involves defining the endpoints, methods, parameters, and data formats for your API.

Methods:

-   GET: This method is used to request data or information from a server.
-   POST: This method is used to send data to a server to be processed.
-   PUT: This method is used to update or replace an existing resource on the server.
-   DELETE: This method is used to delete a resource on the server
-   PATCH: This method is used to make partial updates to an existing resource

You can also specify the Query Parameters and Headers that you want to use.

-   Query Parameters : They are used to specify the specific data or resources that should be included in the response.
-   Headers : Headers are used to specify things like the format of the response, authentication credentials, or caching instructions.

Tools- IF Condition, Variable, Comment**

**IF Condition**

The **IF Condition** in **viaSocket** allows users to enter conditions in their workflows and make decisions based on these conditions. It acts as a gatekeeper, checking for specific conditions before running certain actions in the flow. This not only saves time and effort but also adds a level of control and flexibility to the workflow.

To use the IF Condition tool, the user must first identify the condition they want to check. This can be a simple statement, such as "value === true," or a more complex one involving multiple variables and operators.

The IF Condition tool can handle complex conditions involving multiple variables and operators.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ZAtKwMdiVTRvf3YInWWFKBdOLkwEL4NSJ805tHDJP5yVTwFZpXNooPQA-AH1E3snFSlYwYUpgD_DOP-gasUlOQqC-yncNgr9hNUI2J6alciBzo3YL8wSabp6qNQn3S-0oneewqjVsFc2oea-)

Once the condition is set, the user can then decide the actions to be taken based on the result. They can choose to run specific functions, skip certain steps, or even trigger an error message if the condition is not met. This level of control allows for a more efficient and customized workflow.

**Variable**

**Variable** is a tool that allows users to define and store values that can be used throughout their workflow. These values can be accessed and manipulated as needed, making it easier to perform tasks and automate processes.

Here you can also run one- line codes to customise your workflow according to your needs.

The great thing about these variables is that they can be used in various ways. For example, you can use them inside a function, as a query parameter in an API call, or even within an 'if' condition. This flexibility allows users to customize their workflows according to their specific requirements.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pzjxN4opG7tSTq9HMdnE5jUXX8RW8dQuJwkvBpTn9GNg1ybLwPuckZLY8WWxmFIoxHeEs5ABz6yUl16W8AbfAHlf2hicPS8pVvRieKiyt1GAY7H7K-9Vee0xg4_rKily18oeLL_AanhZCHW-)

By following standard JavaScript syntax, users can easily create variables for different data types and use them in various ways within their workflows. This not only makes the process of workflow automation more efficient but also helps users customize their workflows according to their specific needs.

**Comment**

**Comment block** is a feature that allows users to add **comments** within their workflows. These comments serve as notes or explanations for certain steps in the workflow, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and flow of their processes. This feature is similar to comments in programming languages, where developers add notes to their code to explain its purpose and functionality.
