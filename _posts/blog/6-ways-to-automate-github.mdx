If you're a developer, chances are you've heard of GitHub. What is GitHub, anyway? Imagine a magical place where developers from all around the world can collaborate, share code, and work on projects together seamlessly. That's GitHub! It's a web-based platform that provides a version control system and a collaboration hub for developers. In simpler terms, it's like a social network for code.

GitHub may be an essential app for developers, but using it is not everyone’s cup of tea. That is where automation plays an important role. Using viaSocket as your automation partner, you can integrate GitHub with different apps used by different departments in your business and thus enabling even non developers to contribute to the project.

### 1. Get Real-time Notification for any change on GitHub<a id="1-get-real-time-notification-for-any-change-on-github"></a>

In a company, not everyone works on the same platform, thus conveying important messages will require you to switch between multiple applications, which is quite a time-squandering task. Moreover, there might be a risk that the message gets lost among other messages.

With the help of viaSocket’s automation solutions, you can get instant notifications, ensuring that team members are promptly informed about any code changes. This real-time communication is crucial for collaboration, especially in fast-paced development environments.

Code review plays a pivotal role in the software development lifecycle, serving as a linchpin for code quality and team collaboration. By meticulously examining code contributions, developers can identify and rectify bugs, logic errors, and potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process. Automating the code review process can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of the development workflow.

Many industries have regulatory compliance requirements that necessitate detailed documentation of software changes and updates. These documents not only serve as legal records in the event of disputes but also establish a clear chain of accountability.

Teams can trace each modification back to the specific individual or team responsible. This accountability proves invaluable not just for issue resolution but also for acknowledging and rewarding team members for their contributions.
